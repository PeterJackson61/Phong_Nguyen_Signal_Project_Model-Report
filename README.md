## Audio Classification with Spectrograms

### Overview
This project focuses on audio classification using spectrograms, providing a visual representation of the frequency content of audio signals over time.

### Preprocessing Options
Choose the desired preprocessing method for spectrograms by adjusting the following parameter in the code:

```python
# Set the preprocessing method
# 0 for STFT only
# 1 for Log scale spectrogram
# 2 for Normalized Mel Spectrogram
preprocessing_method = 1
